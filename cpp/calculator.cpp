/*
Program: Calculator
Description: Performs basic arithmetic operations on two integers.

Sample I/O:
  Enter two integers: 10 5
  Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
  Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
  Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
  Division: 10 / 5 = 2
  Modulo: 10 % 5 = 0

    // Perform and display subtraction
    cout << "Subtraction: " << a << " - " << b << " = " << a - b << endl;
    
    // Perform and display multiplication
    cout << "Multiplication: " << a << " * " << b << " = " << a * b << endl;
    
    // Perform and display division (integer division)
    cout << "Division: " << a << " / " << b << " = " << a / b << endl;
    
    // Perform and display modulo (remainder)
    cout << "Modulo: " << a << " % " << b << " = " << a % b << endl;
